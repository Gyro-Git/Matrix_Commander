# Matrix Commander

Matrix Commander is an open-source project dedicated to developing a customizable, 3D-printed wireless remote. This project is built around the Arduino line of microcontrollers.

## About

This project brings together several facets of technology, integrating hardware programming, 3D printing, and wireless connectivity. The end result is a functional human interface device(HID) that can serve as a keyboard or any other HID, making it compatible with any device that supports a regular keyboard.
